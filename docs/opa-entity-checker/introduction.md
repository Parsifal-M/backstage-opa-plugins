# Keep Your Entity Data In Check With OPA Entity Checker

Welcome to a smarter way to ensure data quality! The opa-entity-checker plugin, powered by [OPA](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa), offers a straightforward solution to validate your entities against custom policies. It's a great tool for maintaining high data standards in your Backstage instance. And keeps teams on their toes to ensure data quality is always good.

## How It Works

With opa-entity-checker, you can automatically verify if your entities comply with the policies you've set. It displays a clear, concise card on the entity page, indicating the compliance status:

- **Compliant Entities:** A clean card signifies everything is in order.

- **Non-Compliant Entities:** A detailed card highlights what needs attention.

## Card Violations Variants

The card comes in two flavor: `default` and `compact`. The version you have seen above is the default card.

The compact version is intended to be used as a banner that display how many errors where found, with a dropdown to
