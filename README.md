# Welcome to my Backstage project!

This project exists for me to build and test plugins for Backstage.

You are probably looking for the plugins which can be found in the `plugins/` directory.

# Current plugins

- [opa-backend](./plugins/opa-backend/README.md)
- [opa-entity-checker](./plugins/opa-entity-checker/README.md)
- [opa-permissions-wrapper](./plugins/opa-permissions-wrapper/README.md)
- [dev-quotes-homepage](./plugins/dev-quotes-homepage/README.md)
- [gitlab-my-mr-card](./plugins/gitlab-my-mr-card/README.md) (WIP)
- [gitlab-runners](./plugins/gitlab-runners/README.md) (WIP)

Some of these are not ready for use. See the READMEs for more information.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! However, I am still trying to work out what the best way to achieve smooth collaboration is, the front end plugins are quite easy to spin up in isolation, but the backend plugins are a bit more tricky and require additional setup.

Please open an issue or a pull request. You can also contact me on mastodon at [@parcifal](https://hachyderm.io/@parcifal).
