# Welcome to my Backstage project!

This project exists for me to build and test plugins for Backstage.

You are probably looking for the plugins which have been moved to their own repositories:

- [opa-backend](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/backstage-opa-backend#opa-backend)
- [opa-entity-checker](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/backstage-opa-entity-checker#opa-entity-checker)
- [opa-permissions-wrapper](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/backstage-opa-permissions-wrapper#opa-permissions-wrapper-for-backstage)
- [dev-quotes-homepage](./plugins/dev-quotes-homepage/README.md) (PENDING)
- [gitlab-my-mr-card](./plugins/gitlab-my-mr-card/README.md) (WIP) (PENDING)
- [gitlab-runners](./plugins/gitlab-runners/README.md) (WIP) (PENDING)

Some of these are not ready for use. See the READMEs for more information.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! However, they should be made to the individual plugins, not this repository.

Please open an issue or a pull request. You can also contact me on mastodon at [@parcifal](https://hachyderm.io/@parcifal).
