# Welcome to my Backstage project!

This project exists for me to build and test plugins for Backstage.

You are probably looking for the plugins which can be found in the `plugins/` directory.

# Current plugins

- [opa-backend](./plugins/opa-backend/README.md)
- [opa-entity-checker](./plugins/opa-entity-checker/README.md)
- [opa-permissions-wrapper](./plugins/opa-permissions-wrapper/README.md)
- [gitlab-my-mr-card](./plugins/gitlab-my-mr-card/README.md)
- [gitlab-runners](./plugins/gitlab-runners/README.md)

Some of these are not ready for use. See the READMEs for more information.
