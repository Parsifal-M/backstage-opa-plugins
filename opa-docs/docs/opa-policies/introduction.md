# OPA Policies Plugin Overview

The OPA Policies Plugin is designed to enhance visibility and understanding of the policies applied to entities within the Backstage catalog. By fetching and displaying the specific OPA Policy associated with an entity, this plugin makes it straightforward for users to see at a glance which policies are in effect for any given entity.

This functionality is particularly useful for teams looking to maintain compliance and governance standards across their services, as it provides a clear, accessible view of policy application directly on the entity page in Backstage.
