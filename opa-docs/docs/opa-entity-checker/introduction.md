# Keep Your Entity Data In Check With OPA Entity Checker

Welcome to a smarter way to ensure data quality! The opa-entity-checker plugin, powered by [OPA](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa), offers a straightforward solution to validate your entities against custom policies. It's a great tool for maintaining high data standards in your Backstage instance. And keeps teams on their toes to ensure data quality is always good.

## How It Works

With opa-entity-checker, you can automatically verify if your entities comply with the policies you've set. It displays a clear, concise card on the entity page, indicating the compliance status:

- **Compliant Entities:** A clean card signifies everything is in order.

- **Non-Compliant Entities:** A detailed card highlights what needs attention.

## Card Violations Variants

The card comes in two flavor: `default` and `compact`. The version you have seen above is the default card.

The compact version is intended to be used as a banner that display how many errors where found, with a dropdown to
see the details.

## Entity Processor Validation - Validate all entities always

While the frontend validation allows for quick feedback, users will only see the feedback on visiting an entity. After implementing new rules, you might wonder how many entities are now returning validation error.

This is where catalog processors comes into play. When you discover or import entities into the Backstage catalog, you can run `processors` to (in this case) validate and update entities. The OPA Entity Checker Catalog Processor will validate your entities when they are ingested into the catalog and add an annotation based on the evaluation of the policy!

For instance, the final entity in Backstage might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: backstage.io/v1alpha1
kind: Component
metadata:
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    open-policy-agent/entity-checker-validation-status: error
```

As you can see, an annotation of `open-policy-agent/entity-checker-validation-status: error` has been added to the entity, this is because after the processor ran and checked the metadata against the OPA policy it found a violation which is considered an `error`

```http request
GET http://localhost:7007/api/catalog/entities/by-query?filter=metadata.annotations.open-policy-agent/entity-checker-validation-status=error
Content-Type: 'application/json'
Authorization: Bearer {{BACKSTAGE_TOKEN}}
```
