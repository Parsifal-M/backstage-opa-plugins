# Contributing

I am happy to accept contributions and suggestions for these plugins, if you are looking to make significant changes, please open an issue first to discuss the changes you would like to make!

Please fork the repository and open a PR with your changes. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me on [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@parcifal).

You can also find me in the [Backstage Discord](https://discord.com/invite/backstage-687207715902193673) by pinging `@parsifal` in the plugins channel.

Please remember to sign your commits with `git commit -s` so that the DCO Bot doesn't complain!
