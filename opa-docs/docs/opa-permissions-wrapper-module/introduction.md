# Simplify Permissions with OPA in Backstage

:::tip
Does **NOT** require the `backstage-opa-backend` plugin!
:::

Integrate dynamic policy management into your Backstage instance with the OPA Permissions Wrapper Module. This tool leverages [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) for flexible, easy-to-update permissions management within the [Backstage Permission Framework](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/overview).

- **Dynamic Policy Management:** Use OPA's [Rego language](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) for creating and managing policies without hardcoding them.
- **Instant Updates:** Modify your OPA policies on the fly without needing to redeploy your Backstage instance.
- **Empower Teams:** Allow teams to manage their own policies easily, without deep knowledge of TypeScript or Backstage internals.

## How It Works

This plugin allows you to do two things, the first and foremost is to use it as a way to "wrap" around the Backstage Permission Framework and use the OPA client to evaluate policies. It will send a request to OPA with the permission and identity information, OPA will then evaluate the policy and return a decision, which is then passed back to the Permission Framework, in this scenario you don't need to do anything fancy, just install it and follow the configuration steps.

- Permissions are created in the plugin in which they need to be enforced.
- The plugin will send a request to the Permission Framework backend with the permission and identity information.
- The Permission Framework backend will then forward the request to OPA with the permission and identity information.
- OPA will evaluate the the information against the policy and return a decision.

You can also use the `evaluatePolicy` (see [here](/opa-permissions-wrapper-module/using-evalpolicy.md#using-evaluatepolicy)) function in your backend plugins to evaluate policies. This is useful if you want a bit more flexibility in how you pass the information to OPA and evaluate the policy. You can see an example of this in the [backend demo plugin](https://github.com/Parsifal-M/backstage-opa-plugins/blob/main/plugins/opa-demo-backend/src/router.ts).
