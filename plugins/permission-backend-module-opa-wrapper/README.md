# OPA Permissions Wrapper Module for Backstage

This project is an [Open Policy Agent (OPA)](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) wrapper for the Backstage Permission Framework. The wrapper provides a way to evaluate permissions using OPA, allowing for fine-grained access control and customized policies for your Backstage instance.

This wrapper is still in **development**, you can use it at your own risk, be aware it can change **without** notice.

## Pre-requisites

- This plugin also requires and assumes that you have set up and followed the instructions in the [Backstage Permissions Docs](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/overview) as it of course relies on the permissions framework to be there and set up.

## Key Components

- `permission-evaluator/opaEvaluator.ts`: Defines a policy evaluation function that checks if a given request should be allowed or denied based on a set of policy rules. It uses the OpaClient and configuration provided to evaluate these policies, taking into account the user's identity, and returns a decision accordingly.
- `opa-client/opaClient.ts`: Provides the OpaClient class for communication with the OPA server.

To integrate this OPA wrapper with your Backstage instance, you need to first follow the instructions in the [Backstage Permissions Docs](https://backstage.io/docs/permissions/overview) as it of course relies on the permissions framework to be there and set up.

## I am using the legacy backend system

Then, make the following changes to the `packages/backend/src/plugins/permission.ts` file in your Backstage project. You can replace the contents with something like the following, this allows for flexible policy evaluation and the ability to use multiple OPA policies for different resource types.

```typescript
import { createRouter } from '@backstage/plugin-permission-backend';
import { Router } from 'express-serve-static-core';
import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';
import { BackstageIdentityResponse } from '@backstage/plugin-auth-node';
import {
  PermissionPolicy,
  PolicyQuery,
} from '@backstage/plugin-permission-node';
import { PolicyDecision } from '@backstage/plugin-permission-common';
import {
  OpaClient,
  policyEvaluator,
} from '@parsifal-m/plugin-permission-backend-module-opa-wrapper';

export default async function createPlugin(
  env: PluginEnvironment,
): Promise<Router> {
  const opaClient = new OpaClient(env.config, env.logger);

  const opaRbacPolicy = policyEvaluator(opaClient, env.logger);

  class OpaPermissionPolicy implements PermissionPolicy {
    async handle(
      request: PolicyQuery,
      user?: BackstageIdentityResponse,
    ): Promise<PolicyDecision> {
      return await opaRbacPolicy(request, user);
    }
  }

  return await createRouter({
    config: env.config,
    logger: env.logger,
    discovery: env.discovery,
    policy: new OpaPermissionPolicy(),
    identity: env.identity,
  });
}
```

This will create an OPA client and a permissions handler using the OPA wrapper and pass them to the Backstage Permission Framework.

## I am using the new backend system

Then, make the following changes to the `packages/backend/src/index.ts` file in your Backstage project.

```diff
import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';

const backend = createBackend();
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-app-backend/alpha'));
backend.add(import('@backstage/plugin-auth-backend'));
// ..... other plugins
+ backend.add(import('@parsifal-m/plugin-permission-backend-module-opa-wrapper'));
```

The policy that will be used can be found in `plugins/permission-backend-module-opa-wrapper/src/policy.ts`. It will simply forward all permission requests to OPA.

## Configuration

The OPA client requires configuration to connect to the OPA server. You need to provide the baseUrl and an entrypoint for the OPA server in your Backstage app-config.yaml file:

```yaml
opaClient:
  baseUrl: 'http://localhost:8181'
  policies:
    entityChecker: # Entity checker plugin
      package: 'entity_checker'
    permissions: # Permission wrapper plugin
      entrypoint: 'rbac_policy/decision'
```

Depending on how you have deployed OPA, you may need to change the `baseUrl` to point to the correct location. You can then set the entrypoint for each policy you want to use.

It is also possible to provide an entrypoint to the `policyEvaluator` function, this will override the entrypoint provided in the config. This allows for more flexibility in policy evaluation.

If you do not override the entrypoint, the entrypoint provided in the config will be used.

## An Example Policy and Input

An example policy in OPA might look like this, keep in mind you could also use [bundles](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/management-bundles/) to manage your policies and keep the `conditions` object in a `data.json` file.

```rego
package backstage_policy

import future.keywords.if

# Helper method for constructing a conditional decision
CONDITIONAL(plugin_id, resource_type, conditions) := conditional_decision if {
	conditional_decision := {
		"result": "CONDITIONAL",
		"pluginId": plugin_id,
		"resourceType": resource_type,
		"conditions": conditions,
	}
}

default decision := {"result": "DENY"}

permission := input.permission.name

claims := input.identity.claims

decision := {"result": "ALLOW"} if {
	permission == "catalog.entity.read"
}

decision := CONDITIONAL("catalog", "catalog-entity", {"anyOf": [{
	"resourceType": "catalog-entity",
	"rule": "IS_ENTITY_OWNER",
	"params": {"claims": claims},
}]}) if {
	permission == "catalog.entity.delete"
}

decision := CONDITIONAL("catalog", "catalog-entity", {"anyOf": [{
	"resourceType": "catalog-entity",
	"rule": "IS_ENTITY_KIND",
	"params": {"kinds": ["Component"]},
}]}) if {
	permission == "catalog.entity.read"
}
```

The input sent from Backstage looks like this:

```typescript
export type PolicyEvaluationInput = {
  permission: {
    type: string;
  };
  identity?: {
    user: string | undefined;
    claims: string[];
  };
};
```

It will then return either just an allow decision or both an allow decision and a conditions object if the rule is conditional.
