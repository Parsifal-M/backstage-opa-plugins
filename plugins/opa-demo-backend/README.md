# opa-backend-demo

This plugin serves as a demo for:

- [opa-node](../opa-node/README.md) - A node-library package that allows you to use OPA to make authorization decisions for your backend services and APIs!

It is using the `OpaService` to protect the plugin endpoints.

The policy can be found here: [opa_demo](../../policies/opa_demo.rego)
