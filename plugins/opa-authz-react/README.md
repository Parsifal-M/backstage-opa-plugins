# OPA Authz React

This is a React component library for Backstage that provides a way to interact with an OPA (Open Policy Agent) server for Authorization in the frontend.

You can wrap your components with the `RequireOpaAuthz` component to control the visibility of components based on the result of a policy evaluation.

The component uses the `useOpaAuthz` hook to perform the policy evaluation, and it will render the children only if the policy evaluation `allow` is `true`.

## Why use this library?

Although the Backstage Permissions framework works well for most cases, sometimes you need to add a little more information to your policy input which is not available or possible in the framework. This library aims to provide a more generic way to interact with OPA, and can be used in any part of the Backstage application, and is not tied to the permissions framework in any way, meaning:

- Flexibility to pass your own policy input to OPA.
- Decouple the Authorization logic from the application meaning no rebuilding the application to change the authorization logic.
- More control over the Authorization logic for your own plugins.

Sadly, not all core and community plugins will work with this library for permissions, so you can still use the [plugin-permission-backend-module-opa-wrapper](https://parsifal-m.github.io/backstage-opa-plugins/#/opa-permissions-wrapper-module/introduction) in conjunction with this library if needed which supports the permissions framework.

## Quick Start

### Install the library

Run the yarn install command!

```bash
yarn add --cwd packages/app @parsifal-m/backstage-plugin-opa-authz-react
```

### Add the API

In your `app/src/apis.ts` file, add the following:

```ts
export const apis: AnyApiFactory[] = [
  createApiFactory({
    api: scmIntegrationsApiRef,
    deps: { configApi: configApiRef },
    factory: ({ configApi }) => ScmIntegrationsApi.fromConfig(configApi),
  }),
  // Add the OPA Authz API
  createApiFactory({
    api: opaAuthzBackendApiRef,
    deps: {
      fetchApi: fetchApiRef,
    },
    factory: ({ fetchApi }) => new OpaAuthzClientReact({ fetchApi }),
  }),
  ScmAuth.createDefaultApiFactory(),
];
```

### Using the `RequireOpaAuthz` component

To control and hide a component based on the result of a policy evaluation, you can use the `RequireOpaAuthz` component.

Install the library first to your Backstage plugin:

```bash
yarn add --cwd <your-plugin-directory> @parsifal-m/backstage-plugin-opa-authz-react
```

```tsx
import { RequireOpaAuthz } from '@parsifal-m/backstage-plugin-opa-authz-react';

// Some code...

return (
  <RequireOpaAuthz input={{ action: 'read-policy' }} entryPoint="authz">
    <MyComponent />
  </RequireOpaAuthz>
);
```

The above will render `MyComponent` only if the policy evaluation `allow` is `true`. It will send to OPA the input `{ action: 'read-policy' }` and the entry point `authz`.

### Using the `useOpaAuthz` hook directly (optional)

If you want to use the `useOpaAuthz` hook directly, you can do so:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useOpaAuthz } from '@parsifal-m/backstage-plugin-opa-authz-react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { loading, data, error } = useOpaAuthz(
    { action: 'read-policy' },
    'authz',
  );

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error || !data?.result.allow) {
    return <div>Access Denied</div>;
  }

  return <div>Content</div>;
};
```

## Example Demo Plugin(s)

To help visualize how this library can be used, we have created a demo plugin that demonstrates how to use the `RequireOpaAuthz` component in the frontend, you can find the demo code [here](../../plugins/opa-frontend-demo/README.md).
