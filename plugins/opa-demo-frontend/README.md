# opa-frontend-demo

This plugin serves as a demo for:

- [backstage-opa-authz](./plugins/opa-authz-react/README.md) - A frontend plugin that allows you to make authorization decisions in the frontend using OPA! (Think controlling the visibility of components based on the user's permissions)

It has no real functionality other than to show how the `RequireOpaAuthz` component works.

The policy can be found here: [opa_demo](../../policies/opa_demo.rego)
