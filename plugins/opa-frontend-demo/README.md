# opa-frontend-demo

This plugin serves as a demo for:

- [backstage-opa-authz](./plugins/opa-authz-react/README.md) - A frontend plugin that allows you to control the visibility of components based on the result of an OPA policy evaluation.

It has no real functionality other than to show how the `RequireOpaAuthz` component works.
